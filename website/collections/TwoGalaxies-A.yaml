    These scenes were produced with a "quick and dirty" QuickScene code
    that emits counts images with realistic photometry for galaxies
    with two different SEDs.

    The scene shows two elliptical galaxies with different SEDs from the Bruzal-Charlot Atlas (bc95) positioned on the horizontal axis through the center of the image. The "A" galaxy major axis is aligned with the x axis and the "B" galaxy major axis is rotated 90 degrees.

    We vary these parameters:

    - Galaxy B magnitude (= Galaxy A mag +  Δm) — Δm ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}
    - difference in redshift between two galaxies = Δz — Δz ∈ {0, 1, 2}
    - center-to-center separation along x axis = Δx — Δx ∈ {0.5″, 0.75″, 1.0″, 1.25″}
 
    We are holding these parameters constant to make the high-dimensional parameter space a little more manageable at first:

    - effective radius (25 px or 5 arcsec for both)
    - Sérsic index (n=4 for both)
    - ellipticity (0.5 for both)
    - Galaxy A magnitude (18 ABmag normalized to SDSS _r_)

    We're using these bandpasses from SDSS: u, g, r, i, z.
